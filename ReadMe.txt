Greetings. Here is the codebase for the project 3-Pac, a 3D PacMan clone game. As stated in the document, and as of this moment, here's the 
description of the codebase and the things accomplished.

1) All the basic mechanics have been implemented. Player can turn only on intersections, can consume pellets and will die on touching a ghost.
2) AI is completely functional, made using NavMesh in Unity. No bugs have been encountered as of yet.
3) A simple UI is implemented in the game. A start menu, a score text and a simple death scene.
4) Singleton pattern has been used for the ScoreManager of the game.
5) Object Pooling is used for the pellets. The pellets are scattered randomly across the maze.
